# Mario Bros YAML Cheat Sheet for DevOps and Security Engineers

## Introduction

This year has been all about leveling up my DevOps skills. I completed several training modules from GitLab, worked on personal projects, and am currently diving head first into GitHub Actions. With that being said, learning YAML has been high on my list. As configuration files become more complex mastering YAML syntax while keeping security best practices in mind has become essential. I've put together this Mario Bros-themed cheat sheet (I am a huge Nintendo fan) to make the learning process more engaging while covering the key concepts every DevOps security engineer should know.

## Basic YAML Structure

### Document Start/End
```yaml
---
# Start of YAML document (like starting World 1-1!)
princess: peach
castle: another
...
# End of document (flagpole reached!)
```

### Key-Value Pairs (Power-Up Basics)
```yaml
---
hero: mario
sidekick: luigi
enemy: bowser
power_level: 9001
has_fire_flower: true
coins_collected: 2500
```

## Security-First Examples

### Secure Configuration Management
```yaml
---
# âœ… GOOD: Using environment variables for secrets
mario_config:
  name: mario
  password: ${MARIO_PASSWORD}  # Never hardcode!
  api_key: ${SUPER_MARIO_API_KEY}
  
# BAD: Hardcoded secrets (Bowser can see these!)
# password: "princess_peach_123"
# api_key: "sk-12345678901234567890"
```

### Container Security (Pipe Network)
```yaml
---
pipe_network:
  image: "mario/super-plumber:v1.2.3"  # Always pin versions!
  security_context:
    run_as_non_root: true
    run_as_user: 1000  # Don't run as root Mario!
    read_only_root_filesystem: true
    allow_privilege_escalation: false
  resources:
    limits:
      memory: "512Mi"  # Prevent memory bomb-ombs
      cpu: "500m"
    requests:
      memory: "256Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
```

## Data Types (Power-Up Collection)

### Strings (Dialogue Boxes)
```yaml
---
# Unquoted strings
princess_message: Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!

# Quoted strings (escape sequences work)
mario_speech: "It's-a me, Mario!\nLet's-a go!"

# Single quotes (literal - no escaping)
luigi_speech: 'Mama mia! That\'s a big Goomba!'

# Multi-line strings
bowser_monologue: |
  Gwahahaha! You'll never save Princess Peach!
  My fortress is impenetrable!
  Prepare to face my Koopa army!

# Folded strings (line breaks become spaces)
game_description: >
  Super Mario Bros is a platform game where Mario
  must rescue Princess Peach from Bowser's castle
  by jumping on enemies and collecting power-ups.
```

### Numbers (Score System)
```yaml
---
# Integers
lives_remaining: 3
coins_collected: 2847
current_world: 8
current_level: 4

# Floats
jump_height: 4.5
speed_multiplier: 1.75

# Scientific notation
total_points: 1.23e+6

# Special values
infinite_lives: .inf
undefined_score: .nan
```

### Booleans (Power-Up Status)
```yaml
---
has_super_mushroom: true
has_fire_flower: false
is_invincible: True
can_fly: yes
underground_level: on
boss_defeated: off
```

### Null Values (Missing Items)
```yaml
---
star_power: null
extra_life: ~
magic_mushroom: 
```

## Lists and Arrays (Item Collections)

### Inline Arrays
```yaml
---
power_ups: [mushroom, fire_flower, star, leaf]
world_names: ["Grass Land", "Desert Land", "Water Land", "Giant Land"]
```

### Multi-line Arrays
```yaml
---
mario_enemies:
  - goomba
  - koopa_troopa
  - piranha_plant
  - hammer_bro
  - lakitu
  - bowser

security_scan_results:
  - type: "vulnerability"
    severity: "high"
    description: "Hardcoded Koopa shell in config"
  - type: "misconfiguration" 
    severity: "medium"
    description: "Warp pipe left open to public"
```

## Dictionaries and Objects (Castle Structure)

### Inline Dictionaries
```yaml
---
mario_stats: {strength: 85, speed: 90, jump: 95, lives: 3}
```

### Nested Dictionaries
```yaml
---
bowsers_castle:
  location: "World 8-4"
  difficulty: expert
  traps:
    lava_pits: 12
    moving_platforms: 8
    fake_bowsers: 7
  boss:
    name: "King Bowser"
    health: 100
    attacks: ["fire_breath", "ground_pound", "shell_spin"]
    weakness: "jump_on_head"
  security:
    firewall_enabled: true
    intrusion_detection: active
    backup_system: "multiple_castles"
```

## Security Best Practices (Defensive Power-Ups)

### Kubernetes Security Policies
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mario-pod
  labels:
    hero: mario
    game: super-mario-bros
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1001
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: mario-container
    image: nintendo/mario:latest
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      capabilities:
        drop:
        - ALL
        add:
        - NET_BIND_SERVICE  # Only for pipe network access
    env:
    - name: PRINCESS_LOCATION
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: castle-secrets
          key: princess-coordinates
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Security
```yaml
---
name: "Super Mario Deployment Pipeline"
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, world-*]
  
jobs:
  security_scan:
    runs-on: mushroom-kingdom-runner
    steps:
    - name: "Scan for Koopa Trojan"
      run: |
        trivy image nintendo/mario:${{ github.sha }}
        
    - name: "Check for hardcoded coins"
      run: |
        grep -r "coin.*[0-9]{4,}" . && exit 1 || echo "No hardcoded coins found!"
        
    - name: "Validate power-up configurations"
      run: |
        yamllint config/power-ups.yml
        
  deploy:
    needs: security_scan
    environment: production
    steps:
    - name: "Deploy to Mushroom Kingdom"
      env:
        CASTLE_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.CASTLE_ACCESS_KEY }}
        WARP_PIPE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WARP_PIPE_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        kubectl apply -f k8s/mario-deployment.yml
```

## Common Security Pitfalls (Avoid These Goombas!)

### What NOT to do:
```yaml
---
# DON'T: Hardcode secrets
database_password: "princess_peach_123"
api_key: "sk-bowser-castle-key-123456"

# DON'T: Use latest tags in production
container_image: "mario/game:latest"

# DON'T: Run as root
security_context:
  runAsUser: 0  # This is root Mario - very dangerous!

# DON'T: Allow all privileges
containers:
  securityContext:
    privileged: true  # Bowser's dream come true!
```

### What TO do:
```yaml
---
# DO: Use environment variables for secrets
database_password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
api_key: ${MARIO_API_KEY}

# DO: Pin specific versions
container_image: "mario/game:v2.1.3"

# DO: Use non-root users
security_context:
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsNonRoot: true

# DO: Limit privileges
containers:
  securityContext:
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    capabilities:
      drop: ["ALL"]
```

## Advanced YAML Features (Special Items)

### Anchors and Aliases (Warp Pipes for Code Reuse)
```yaml
---
# Define an anchor (like placing a warp pipe)
mario_defaults: &mario_config
  type: plumber
  hat_color: red
  overalls_color: blue
  special_ability: jump

# Use the alias (warp to the config)
characters:
  mario:
    <<: *mario_config
    name: "Mario Mario"
    
  luigi:
    <<: *mario_config
    name: "Luigi Mario"
    hat_color: green
    overalls_color: green
```

### Multi-Document Files (Multiple Worlds)
```yaml
---
# World 1: Grass Land
world: 1
theme: grass
levels: 8
boss: "King Koopa"
...
---
# World 2: Desert Land
world: 2
theme: desert
levels: 8
boss: "Desert King"
...
```

## Quick Reference Card

| Feature | Example | Security Note |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Secrets** | `password: ${SECRET}` | Never hardcode! |
| **Comments** | `# This is secure` | Document security choices |
| **Multi-line** | `description: \|` | Use for security policies |
| **Lists** | `- item1` | Validate all entries |
| **Booleans** | `enabled: true` | Be explicit with security flags |
| **Null** | `value: null` | Handle missing configs safely |
